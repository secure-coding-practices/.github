Secure coding practices are a set of guidelines and principles that developers follow to write software code that is resistant to security threats and vulnerabilities. The goal is to create robust and secure applications that protect against various attacks, such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and code exploits. These practices are crucial in today's digital landscape, where cyber threats constantly evolve.

Secure coding is integral to the software development life cycle, encompassing the design, implementation, testing, and maintenance phases. It involves a proactive approach to identify and address potential security issues early in development, reducing the likelihood of security breaches.

Secure coding practices are paramount in building resilient and secure software applications. By adopting these principles and best methods, developers can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches, safeguard user data, and contribute to a more secure digital environment. Ongoing education, proactive testing, and a commitment to security throughout development are essential components of a robust, secure coding strategy.
